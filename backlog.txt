I'd like to make the input and output of the data generalizable to support other types later. Can we start architecting some interfaces to allow this. For now, I think I'd like to plan out these features:
-Input interface
--Concrete Implementation of input as 'Vectronic Binv2' (this is how my data currently comes in)
-Output interface
--Concrete Implementation of output as 'BEBE' (this is how I'd like my data to be generated for the first pass)
-Some mechanism to list all known input and output concrete classes.

What high level considerations should we talk about first?
