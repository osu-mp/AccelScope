Output CSVs
Output graphs
Fix labeled action text to match rest of GUI (matplotlib format)
Add labels to X (include date) and Y; title
Import BEBE prediction CSVs into viewer, show human labels vs BEBE predictions

Interface and class for reading data
Interface and classes for writing data

Bugfixes:
Invalid CSV loaded (try loading activity data instead of motion)


I'd like to make the input and output of the data generalizable to support other types later. Can we start architecting some interfaces to allow this. For now, I think I'd like to plan out these features:
-Input interface
--Concrete Implementation of input as 'Vectronic Binv2' (this is how my data currently comes in)
-Output interface
--Concrete Implementation of output as 'BEBE' (this is how I'd like my data to be generated for the first pass)
-Some mechanism to list all known input and output concrete classes.

What high level considerations should we talk about first?

[DONE] Fix plots to +/- 5 acc  y values
Combine plots (+- 6 hours)

Future:
-ability to set 'display-name' per file
-Put y-limits in project config
